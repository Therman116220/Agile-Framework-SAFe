Part of Activity Ratio. Time from when work was ready after the previous station to completion

Process Time(PT) -
    Percent of Activity Ratio. Time to complete actual value-added work

Percent Complete & Accuracy (%C&A) -
    Percent of work that the next station could process as-is

Activity Ratio -
    Measures activity efficiency (PT/LT)

FLOW-the ratio between your active time and total time

Rolled Percent Compl. & Accuracy -
    Efficiency of entire flow
EX:divide actively work time w/ total cycle time
    then multiply results by hundred.
    (%C&A 1 %C&A 2 %C&A n * 100)

Lean -
Define the hypothesis,
build a minimum viable product (MVP),
continuously evaluate the MVP & implement additional features
